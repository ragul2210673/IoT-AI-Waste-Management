# IoT-AI-Waste-Management
This project automates waste management using AI and IoT. A CNN model classifies waste (biodegradable, recyclable, hazardous) from images, while RFID tags identify e-waste. Servo motors sort items into bins. IoT sensors monitor bin levels and hazardous gases, sending real-time alerts via ThingSpeak and Twilio to prevent overflow and ensure safety.
